# Learn luminance

You’re here because you want to learn luminance. Here is the chapter summary.

## Everything you should know before jumping in

Let’s just list everything you want to know before learning:

- The [official GitHub repository](https://github.com/phaazon/luminance-rs)
- The [luminance examples](https://github.com/phaazon/luminance-rs/blob/master/luminance/examples/README.md).
  Those are useful when you know what you are looking for and would like to see quickly how to do
  it with luminance, or just to have a rough idea of what’s supported.
- Spotted a bug? A typo? A performance issue? You need a feature that’s not already available? Shoot it
  [here](https://github.com/phaazon/luminance-rs/issues).
